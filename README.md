## About

LifeFlow is a system that allows the elderly to take control of their own health by giving them the ability to monitor their vitals from home. The LifeFlow device has other features such as medication reminders which help remind users to take their medication at the right time. This allows the elderly to be more independent, reducing their reliance on others such as carers and family members.

LifeFlow monitors vitals by using modular sensors that attach to the main device. These modules include heart rate, blood oxygen and body temperature. Another important feature of LifeFlow is its emergency alert system; with the press of a single button the device is able to alert the emergency services and up to three emergency contacts.

We created the device with accessibility in mind. The device has a simple user interface and accessibility features; making it easy to use. The module system is simple allowing users to connect the necessary sensors and tools depending on their needs. The system setup is also simple, with only 3 steps which when completed gives you full access to the device.

Finally, the device is enclosed in a custom designed 3D-printed case giving it a finished look. Furthermore, the module function that makes the sensor separate to the main device allows it to be small and compact allowing the device to be taken anywhere.
