## About

LifeFlow is a system that allows the elderly to take control of their own health by giving them the ability to monitor their vitals from home. The LifeFlow device uses a Raspberry Pi to log sensor readings which can be used to inform treatment plans and monitor the health of patients. LifeFlow also has medication reminders which prompt users to take their medication at the right time. This allows the elderly to be more independent, reducing their reliance on others such as carers and family members. 
LifeFlow monitors vitals by using modular sensors that attach to the main device. These modules currently include heart rate, blood oxygen and body temperature. Another important feature of LifeFlow is its emergency alert system: with the press of a single button the device is able to alert the emergency services and up to three emergency contacts. 
We created the device with accessibility in mind. The device has a simple user interface and accessibility features making it easy to use. The modular system allows users to connect to most relevant sensors and tools depending on their needs which can be customized for an individualâ€™s treatment plan.
The initial system setup is designed to be as simple as possible, with only 3 steps which include choosing a language, entering your personal details and emergency contact information.
Our working prototype is enclosed in a custom-designed 3D-printed case giving it a stylish and easy to use appearance that is ready to scale up to boost independent living, quality of life and save money for the NHS.

## Build Guide
### Parts
- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- [Elegoo Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Display](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01MRQTMTD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 )
- [MAX30102 Heart Rate and Pulse Oximetry Sensor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09M87934Q?psc=1&smid=AY8YTBRZSL2Q4&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp)
- [MLX90614 Non Contact Thermometer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07YKNQQ7P?psc=1&smid=A1A7E5ILEFA1R3&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp)

### Build

- Firstly we formatted an SD card with Raspberry Pi OS then we inserted the SD card and connected the toushcreen via the GPIO pins. We added a [Nano Hat Hacker](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-hat-hacker?variant=44144542154) to gain access to the used GPIO.
- We installed the necessary [tools and drivers](https://www.elegoo.com/pages/download) for the [Touchscreen Display](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01MRQTMTD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) following the instructions [here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/3.5inch_RPi_LCD_(A))
- We progammed the User Interface with python, html, css and javascript using the [eel library](https://pypi.org/project/Eel/). We then transferred this code to the Pi using GitHub.
- We soldered some wires onto the emergency button and then connected it to the GPIO pins as shown below

- For our prototype we have got the infrared temperature working so far:
- Connect each pin as shown below:
 >-  Vin on the temperature sensor to 3v on the Pi (physical pin 1) 
 >- Gnd on the temperature sensor to Gnd on the Pi (physical pin 9)
 >- SCL (I2C clock) on the temperature sensor to SCL on the Pi (Physical pin 5 / GPIO3)
 >- SDA (I2C data) on the temperature sensor to SDA on the Pi (Physical pin 3 / GPIO2)

Our next iteration involved using some PCB prototyping board rather than a bread board as shown below:

During prototyping we designed our cases using Sketchup. We designed our initial prototype cases to have as thin walls as possible to reduce the amount of plastic and limit the environmental impact of the development cycle but our final design would have a thicker case in order to be more durable.

In order to test the device you need to copy the files from the [github repository](https://github.com/pddring/LifeFlow/tree/main/life-flow-main) and run it using the command `python3 main.py`

The first time you run this it will require a number of python libraries which can be installed by running:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install pip3
pip3 install eel pyautogui pyautogui pyautogui pyautogui pyautogui gpiod Adafruit-Blinka adafruit-circuitpython-mlx90614 
```

To power the device we are using a solar powered USB battery pack:

## Our Business Models
The cost of medical technology can sometimes be prohibitive but our business plan maps out how LifeFlow can not only improve the health, independence and quality of life for patients but also reduce private health insurance premiums, save money for care homes and reduce the strain on NHS primary healthcare.
